A Hero's Story
#######

*Whosoever will be great among you, shall be your minister: And whosoever of you will be the chiefest, shall be servant of all.* Mark 10:43-44

**This is a story about the greatest female warrior of all time - a lady with nine wounds and twelve medals, a hero, a mother, a patriot, a comrade, and a source of inspiration to this day - Milunka Savić**

Early Life & Mobilization
------------

Milunka Savić was born in 1890 (or 1892, according to her membership card of the Association of Reserve Military Officers) in the village of Koprivnica near Jošanička Banja in Raška, Serbia, to mother Danica and father Radenko, as the eldest child. 
She had two younger sisters Miona and Slavka and her brother Milan, and was raised in a consercative rural family, where children were tought to be virtuous and honest people, and to love their neighbour and their country. 
She grew into a beautiful, tall and strong girl, while her brother Milan was weak young man prone to illness. After the publication of the Decree on Mobilization on September 30 / October 3 1912, Milunka decided to register at one of the mobilization gatherings in Belgrade, instead of her brother. She registered under the name Milun Savić. 

*I'm going to war, and how will I go to war if I don't learn how to be a man. It's not just: `Milunka, put on men's clothes, cut your hair, tighten your chest and that's it, you've become a man` but, my brother, I have to practice my speech and posture. Yes, posture... I, Milun Savić, a shy guy, will always be on guard, not to say my real name when asked.*
