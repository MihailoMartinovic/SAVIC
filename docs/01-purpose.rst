The SAVIC software intends to combine:

* predictor of the VDF stability - SAVIC-P
* regressors that quantify the parameters of the MUM - SAVIC-Q
* classifiers that recognize the type of instability predicted for the given VDF - SAVIC-C


SAVIC software is a combination of the three components listed above. 
However, each of the given codes can also be used separately.
