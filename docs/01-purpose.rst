The SAVIC software intends to combine:

* Predictor of the VDF stability "--" SAVIC-P
* Regressors that quantify the parameters of the MUM &mdash; SAVIC-q
* Classifiers that recognize the type of instability predicted for the given VDF --- SAVIC-c


SAVIC software is a combination of the three components listed above. 
However, each of the given codes can also be used separately.
